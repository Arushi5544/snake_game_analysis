Comparative analysis of snake game in C and Python Programming languages

# Snake Game in C
* console-based Snake game implemented in C.
* snake.c: Main source file containing the game implementation.
## Header Files
* conio.h: Provides console input/output functions (e.g.- kbhit and getch).
* stdio.h: Standard Input/Output functions.
* stdlib.h: Standard Library functions (e.g.- rand).
* unistd.h: Contains the sleep function.

## Functions
* setup: Initializes the game state, including the snake's starting position and random fruit placement.
* draw: Clears the console screen and renders the game board, snake, fruit, and score.
* input: Handles user input to control the snake's direction and quit the game.
* logic: Manages the game logic, including snake movement, collision detection, and score updates.
* main: Orchestrates the game loop.

## Data Structures and Algorithms
* Basic game loop for continuous execution.
* Random number generation for fruit placement.
* Simple collision detection to check for boundaries.
* Use of global variables to maintain the game state.
